// Runs an infinite loop that listens to the keyboard input.
// When a key is pressed (any key), the program blackens the screen,
// i.e. writes "black" in every pixel;
// the screen should remain fully black as long as the key is pressed.
// When no key is pressed, the program clears the screen, i.e. writes
// "white" in every pixel;
// the screen should remain fully clear as long as no key is pressed.

// This file was made to refactor and improve runtime when compared to Fill.asm

// RAM[0] will store a number relative to the current address
// RAM[1] will store if the screen is either black or white
// RAM[2] will store the color the screen will change to
